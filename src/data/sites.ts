Many a trial befell that Sacred Beauty for well-nigh fifty years, such that the pen trembleth at their mention. The first was the exile from Persia; the second, the banishment from Iraq to the Ottoman capital; the third, the exile from that city to European Turkey and Bulgaria; and the fourth, the banishment of the Beauty of the All-Merciful to the depths of the Most Great Prison. Throughout this period, a myriad other tribulations also befell Him from within and without. Light of the World: Selected Tablets of 'Abdu'l-Bahá, p.3. It would be from his prison cell and from Adrianople that Bahá'u'lláh produced some of His most weighty writings. Among these were letters, addressing individually a number of the kings and rulers of his time: Pope Pius IX, Napoleon III, Czar Alexander II, Queen Victoria, and Nasiri'd-Din Shah.",
